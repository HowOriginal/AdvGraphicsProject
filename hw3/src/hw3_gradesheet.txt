includes discussion of performance/quality

-Stratefied sampling implemented for both soft shadows and of pixel in image plane. See README for discussion.

OTHER DISTRIBUTION RAY TRACING EXTRA CREDIT [ 2 ]
glossy surfaces, motion blur, or depth of field, etc.

-Implemented glossy surfaces, see README for details

BASIC FORM FACTOR COMPUTATION [ 2 / 2 ]
Description of method in README.txt.  
  ./render -size 200 200 -input cornell_box.obj

-Implemented. See README.

RADIOSITY SOLVER [ 3 / 3 ]
May be iterative (solution fades in) or done by inverting the form
factor matrix.

-Implemented.

FORM FACTORS WITH VISIBILITY / OCCLUSION RAY CASTING [ .5 / 1 ]
  ./render -size 300 150 -input l.obj 
  ./render -size 300 150 -input l.obj -num_form_factor_samples 100
  ./render -size 300 150 -input l.obj -num_shadow_samples 1 
  ./render -size 300 150 -input l.obj -num_form_factor_samples 10 -num_shadow_samples 1 
  ./render -size 200 200 -input cornell_box_diffuse_sphere.obj -sphere_rasterization 16 12
  ./render -size 200 200 -input cornell_box_diffuse_sphere.obj -sphere_rasterization 16 12 -num_shadow_samples 1

-Not implemented.

RADIOSITY EXTRA CREDIT [ 0 ]
1 point for ambient term in radiosity
1-2 points for new test scene or visualization
1 point for writing the ray traced image to a file
1-3 points extra credit for performance improvements
1-3 points for other ray tracing effects
1-3 points for gradient or discontinuity meshing in radiosity 

-Not done.

PHOTON DISTRIBUTION [ 0 / 2 ]
Shoots photons into the scene and the visualization looks reasonable
(the heart shape can be seen in the ring).
  ./render -size 200 200 -input reflective_ring.obj -num_photons_to_shoot 10000 -num_bounces 2 -num_shadow_samples 10
  ./render -size 200 200 -input reflective_ring.obj -num_photons_to_shoot 500000 -num_bounces 2 -num_shadow_samples 10 -num_antialias_samples 4

-Not implemented.

RAY TRACING WITH PHOTONS [ 0 / 2 ]
Searching for photons in the kdtree to use in ray tracing.  The
caustic ring is visible, and there are no significant artifacts in
illumination.

-Not implemented.

PHOTON MAPPING MATCHES RADIOSITY [ 0 ]
The intensity and color bleeding of photon mapping for indirect
illumination are correctly weighted and closely matches the results
from radiosity.  2 points extra credit.
  ./render -size 200 200 -input cornell_box_diffuse_sphere.obj -num_photons_to_shoot 500000 -num_shadow_samples 500 -num_photons_to_collect 500 

-Not implemented.

OTHER EXTRA CREDIT [ 0 ]
1-2 points for new test scene or visualization
1 point for writing the ray traced image to a file
1-3 points extra credit for performance improvements
2-5 points for irradiance caching

-None done.
